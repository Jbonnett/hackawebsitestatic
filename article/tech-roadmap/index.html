Here is a rough list:</p><ul><li>A bit of programing. At least enough to be able to write a script to process text.</li><li>A bit of digital electronics. At least enough to know what a and gate and a xor is.</li><li>Networking at all of the different layers.<ul><li>from physical (ethernet at the electrical and packet level)</li><li>arp/mac</li><li>then tcp, ipv4, udp, and ipv6</li><li>nat, routing, vpn, dns, dhcp, bgp and even proxies.</li></ul></li><li>Then a bit about web topics, http, tls, rest, api security, javascript and the browser domain model</li><li>How to use the debug tools for javascript that come with chrome and firefox</li><li>How to use them for security work, NOT JUST BURP SUITE.</li><li>DNS as it pertains to domain security and tls.</li><li>A bit of cryptography (I really like the coursera crypto I web course), not just the math and the algorithims but for the awareness of information leakage it gives you.</li><li>Maybe some x86 and arm assembly</li><li>Disasembly techniques using tools like idapro and ghidra, but also learn to read source code, even for languages you only kinda know.</li><li>Dynamic analysis/debugging using gdb, java debuggers, pythons pdb, and/or the debuggers for c#.</li><li>Make sure you spend some time with regex and databases so you can effectively search logs and reconstruct events.</li><li>Linux/Unix administration and using the shell.</li><li>Either android or IOS internals.</li><li>How to exit vim. ðŸ˜„</li></ul><p>Don&rsquo;t worry if the list seems overwelming, you have the rest of your life to do it, and you don&rsquo;t need all of it to get your first job, but the broader your understanding is, the more you realize there is no &ldquo;magic&rdquo; and the more kinds of problems you can solve.</p><p>More to come.</p></div></div></main></div><footer class=footer><span>*This website does NOT condone illegal actions, or even legal but immoral ones.
